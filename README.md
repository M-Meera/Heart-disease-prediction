# Heart-disease-prediction
The code begins by importing essential Python libraries and reading a 
dataset from a CSV file. It uses data visualization to display the 
distribution of heart disease and no-disease cases, as well as the 
percentage breakdown. The code identifies missing values and creates 
a histogram distribution plot for a specific column. It then splits the 
data into training and testing sets for model evaluation. The Random 
Forest Classifier is trained and tested, yielding a certain accuracy score. 
A classification report provides detailed performance metrics, and a 
confusion matrix heatmap visualizes the model's classification results. 
Finally, an ROC curve is plotted to assess the classifier's overall 
performance. This code essentially represents a comprehensive 
pipeline for building and evaluating a heart disease prediction model 
using machine learning techniques.
